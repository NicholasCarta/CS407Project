Dataset: The dataset consists of training images and validation images take from frames of the video that were split using FFMpeg. For training there are about 700 images and 400 images for validation by the model.
An interesting side effect of splitting the training and validation data this way is that the validation data contains much less examples of vehicles compared to the training data. This gives the model a harder time detcting and identifying vehicles. To address this another training run will be done to bolster the validation data.
